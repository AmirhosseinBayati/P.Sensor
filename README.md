# ParkingSensor

A simple, proof of concept, car-parking sensor that will tell you when you're too close to the wall (or other obstacles). This project has it's origins [here](https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1967946) (Dutch). The schema is a bit messy; I currently don't have a decent circuit editor... Sorry 'bout that!

With a little effort this circuit can be extended with another HC SR-04 sensor and LED, but I'll leave that up to the reader.
